Input one character and hit Enter button as 1 time input. (If more than 1 charaters, only the first one will be counted).
Input "end" as a terminator to stop input process.

Notice:
Because I couldn't fetch the dictionary from the link successfully, I only made a very simple dictionary by myself. Dictionary content can only be modified by changing the code part of DictionaryGenerator class.
